Create a single page application with React

Task 1: Home Page and Navigation

Problem Statement:
Create a home page for an application. Include a navigation bar with links to the following
pages: Home, All Products,Contact Us & Login/Register. Having a nice parallax effect and a
unique design at the homepage would be a plus.
Implement a search at the navigation bar where users can search for products. Integrate
search functionality that provides real-time results. If any product matches with the searched
product then show it to the all course page. Ensure the search is efficient and user-friendly.
Implement a dropdown in the navigation bar that shows matching products in real-time as
the user types. Clicking on a product in the dropdown should take the user directly to the All
products page.

Task 2: All Products Page

Problem Statement:
Expand the "All Products" page to allow users to browse and filter different products
effectively. Fetch and display product data from a mock API or use a library like Faker.js.
Each product should have a link to its details page.
Enhance the "All Products" page with advanced filtering options. Allow users to filter
products based on categories, price range, and other relevant attributes. Implement a
smooth user experience with real-time filtering. Also insure pagination for displaying all
products.
Categorise the products into different categories. Each product should belong to one or more
categories. Implement a category filter that allows users to view products based on selected
categories.

Task 3: Product Details Page

Problem Statement:
Create a product details page that displays detailed information about a selected product.
Include an option to add the product to the cart. Ensure the route updates dynamically based
on the selected product. Add a slider for multiple images of a product.

Task 4: Cart Management with Redux

Problem Statement:
Implement a shopping cart that manages the added products using Redux. Allow users to
add, remove, and update quantities of items in the cart. Display the total price dynamically
and handle any edge cases.
A list of cart products should be shown to an individual page where users can buy them by
clicking on the ‘proceed payment’ button.

Task 5: User Authentication with Firebase

Problem Statement:
Integrate Firebase authentication for user registration and login. Include the option for users
to sign in using their Google account. Implement a secure system where only logged-in
users can access the buying functionality.

Problem Statement:
Create a dashboard accessible only to logged-in users. Display only order history. Ensure
the dashboard is protected from unauthorised access.

Task 7: Contact Us Page with Frontend Mail Library

similar) to send emails to a predefined address when the form is submitted. Include
necessary validation and error handling.

on both desktop and mobile devices. You may use media queries, flexbox, or any CSS
framework of your choice.
